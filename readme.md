<p align="center"><strong>Runic Enchanting</strong> adds a way to craft enchanted books using runes found throughout the world.</p><br/><br/>
<img align="center" src="img/banner_rune_enchanting.png"/>
<p align="center">Every enchantment can be crafted with a sequence of rune pages at the <strong>Rune Enchanting Table</strong>.</p><br/><br/>
<img align="center" src="img/banner_rune_scribing.png"/>
<p align="center">Rune pages are written at the <strong>Rune Scribing Table</strong>. Much like how the vanilla enchanting table behaves with bookshelves, the Rune Scribing Table needs <strong>Rune Blocks</strong> nearby. Inorder to craft a rune page the corresponding rune block must be within range of the Scribing Table.</p><br/><br/>
<img align="center" src="img/rune_block_in_the_wild.png">
<p align="center">Rune Blocks generate naturally in the Overworld and Nether dimensions. You can find a variety of Rune Structures on the surface, in caves, and even underwater. Each structure will have one or more rune blocks. This is a Life Rune carved onto a chiseled stone bricks block, which generated in a lush caves biome.</p><br/><br/>

<p align="center">Rune blocks when mined will drop their respective chiseled block variant, even with the Silk Touch enchantment. To obtain rune blocks for the Scribing Table use <strong>Chalk</strong> on the block while holding paper in the offhand. This will make a <strong>Rune Pattern</strong> of that rune, which can be used to make additional rune blocks in the future.</p><br/><br/>
<img align="center" src="img/rune_paste.png"/>
<p align="center">A rune pattern has no durability, so will never break, and is not used up in the process of making a rune block. Once a rune pattern is obtained it can be infinitely used to make new rune blocks. To make a rune block, use a <strong>Chisel</strong> on any chiseled block, like chiseled stone bricks, while holding the desired rune pattern in the offhand. This will convert the chiseled block into a rune block.</p>
<p align="center">Rune Patterns can also be used at the Loom to draw patterns on banners, which can then be applied to shields.</p><br/><br/>
